Data analysis using python, API data, and various visualization methods. 



### WeatherPy

###### Conclusions

1. The temperature data is linear when plotted vs latitude. This means that it does, in fact, get hotter towards the equator.
2. Temperatures are shifted to be higher slightly north of the equator, which is due to it being closer to the summer solstice in the northern hemisphere.
3. The data set in the northern hemisphere is much larger due to higher population and more land-mass translating to more cities selected in a random selection.
4. The other analyzed variables (wind speed, cloudiness, humidity) did not have much correlation with latitude. Humidity may correlate weakly, but more data would be required to determine an association there.

### VacationPy

###### Conclusions

1. Plotted humidity on the heat map to visualize the locations that might be more comfortable.
2. Narrowed down a short-list of cities based on preferred weather criteria.
3. Searched for a hotel close to each city.
4. Plotted those cities and the hotel data on the humidity heat map. Looks like I may be headed to Angola or Saudi Arabia.
